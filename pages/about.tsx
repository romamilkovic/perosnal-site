            I started developing and designing websites at school. Since then I have a
            passion for designing and building user interfaces that are user friendly and
            fast.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since 2014 I have worked as a freelancer with awesome clients and have
            launched many projects. Working as a UI/UX designer and Frontend developer I
            realized that I cannot live without one of this things.
          </p>
          <p>
            I love to create things that people enjoy to use. From idea to prototyping and
            development with testing. I am inspired by everything related to technology
            and the web. Keep learning new stuff everyday and do open-source projects. As
            well as trying to share my experience in my blog.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my spare time you can find me doing yoga, running, reading or spending time
            with my family.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can find all technologies that I use, experience and other details in
