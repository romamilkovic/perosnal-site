          <h2>Beginning</h2>
          <p>
            I started developing and designing websites at school. Participated in
            olympiads and various competitions. Since then I have a passion for designing
            and building user interfaces that are user friendly and fast.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since 2014 I have worked as a freelancer with awesome clients and have
            launched many projects, one of my favorite was <strong>2do2go</strong>. Also
            worked with some design studios where we&apos;re creating design systems for
            web and mobile.
          </p>
          <h2>The moment</h2>
          <p>
            The big change in my career happened in 2016 when I started working at{' '}
            <strong>ServerHub</strong>. I started working as UI/UX designer but after few
            month I was involved in Frontend development. I already knew well HTML/CSS and
            many methodologies to make code clean and consistent such as BEM. But there
            was a lack of strong knowledge in Javascript.
          </p>
          <p>
            So I successfuly finished few basic and advanced courses of Javascript at{' '}
            <strong>htmlacademy</strong>. After that I learned <strong>Vuejs</strong> and
            did a few internal projects using it. It was an amazing experience and
            journey. Projects are still working and went through the whole development
            path of <strong>Vuejs</strong> from v1 to v3. Including Nuxtjs that was
            primarily used for <strong>SSR/SSG</strong> apps.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also have experience working on backend side using Nodejs, some of databases
            such as <strong>MySQL</strong>
            (MariaDB), <strong>Mongodb</strong>, technologies like <strong>WEBRTC</strong>
            , <strong>Websocket</strong>, frameworks <strong>Express</strong>,{' '}
            <strong>Koa</strong>, <strong>TypeORM</strong>, <strong>NestJS</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            While I changed direction in my career into Frontend development, I still
            designing user interfaces in our internal projects. Especially designing and
            developing design systems.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can find all technologies that I use, experience and other details in
            my&nbsp;
