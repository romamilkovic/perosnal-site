            I started developing and designing websites at school. Participated in
            olympiads and various competitions. Since then I have a passion for designing
            and building user interfaces that are user friendly and fast.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since 2014 I have worked as a freelancer with awesome clients and have
            launched many projects, one of my favorite was <b>2do2go</b>. Also worked with
            some design studios where we&apos;re creating design systems for web and
            mobile.
          </p>
          <p>
            The big change in my career happened in 2016 when I started working at{' '}
            <b>ServerHub</b>. I started working as UI/UX designer but after few month I
            was involved in Frontend development. I already knew well HTML/CSS and many
            methodologies to make code clean and consistent such as BEM. But there was a
            lack of strong knowledge in Javascript.
          </p>
          <p>
            So I successfuly finished few basic and advanced courses of Javascript at{' '}
            <b>htmlacademy</b>. After that I learned <b>Vuejs</b> and did a few internal
            projects using it. It was an amazing experience and journey. Projects are
            still working and went through the whole development path of <b>Vuejs</b> from
            v1 to v3. Including Nuxtjs that was primarily used for <b>SSR/SSG</b> apps.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also have experience working on backend side using Nodejs, some of databases
            such as <b>MySQL</b>
            (MariaDB), <b>Mongodb</b>, technologies like <b>WEBRTC</b>, <b>Websocket</b>,
            frameworks <b>Express</b>, <b>Koa</b>, <b>TypeORM</b>, <b>NestJS</b>.
          </p>
          <p>
            While I changed direction in my career into Frontend development, I still
            designing user interfaces in our internal projects. Especially designing and
            developing design systems.
          </p>
